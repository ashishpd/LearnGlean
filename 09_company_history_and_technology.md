## Founding Story

### The Problem

The idea for Glean emerged from founder Arvind Jain's firsthand experience with a critical workplace challenge: **information fragmentation**.

#### The Challenge

As organizations grew and adopted more SaaS tools, employees faced increasing difficulty:

1. **Information Silos**: Data scattered across dozens of applications
   - Documents in SharePoint, Google Drive, Dropbox
   - Messages in Slack, Teams, email
   - Project data in Jira, Asana, Monday.com
   - Customer data in Salesforce, HubSpot
   - Knowledge bases in Confluence, Notion

2. **Productivity Loss**: Employees wasting time searching
   - Not knowing which system contains needed information
   - Searching multiple applications separately
   - Missing information that exists but isn't discoverable
   - Recreating work that already exists elsewhere

3. **Knowledge Gaps**: Organizational knowledge not accessible
   - Expertise not discoverable
   - Previous work not findable
   - Best practices not accessible
   - Institutional knowledge lost

#### The Insight

Jain recognized that while individual applications were powerful, the **lack of unified search** was a fundamental productivity killer. Employees needed a way to search across all their tools from one place, with AI that understood context and intent.

### The Solution Vision

Glean was conceived as:
- **Unified Search**: One search interface for all organizational data
- **AI-Powered**: Understanding meaning, not just keywords
- **Permission-Aware**: Respecting security boundaries
- **Easy to Use**: Natural language, no training required
- **Continuously Learning**: Getting better with usage

### Why 2019?

The timing was strategic:

1. **AI Maturity**: AI/ML technologies had reached sufficient maturity
   - Large language models becoming practical
   - Vector embeddings and semantic search advancing
   - NLP capabilities improving

2. **Enterprise Readiness**: Enterprises were ready
   - Cloud adoption widespread
   - API ecosystems mature
   - Security and compliance frameworks established

3. **Market Timing**: Perfect storm of factors
   - SaaS proliferation creating the problem
   - Remote work increasing information needs
   - AI becoming enterprise-acceptable
